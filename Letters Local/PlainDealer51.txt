GOP suppresses minority voting
I take exception to Ted Diadiun’s Sept. 14 column, “Golden Week or not, opportunity exists for anyone to vote in Nov.,” accusing voting-rights advocates of being “dishonest” and “disingenuous” because we refuse to stand by while Republicans cut voting opportunities in Ohio. If anyone is being disingenuous, it’s the supporters of legislation to eliminate Golden Week, who claim they are only trying to make life easier for election workers or combat voter fraud.

Ohio Republicans have methodically rolled back voters’ rights on a partisan basis. They cut early voting, invalidated more provisional ballots and restricted poll workers from helping voters.

This is not just a problem in Ohio. Republicans in Wisconsin have used baseless claims of voter fraud for partisan gain. I also urge readers of The Plain Dealer to investigate what North Carolina’s Republican-con-trolled legislature did to disenfranchise African-Americans

The similarities to Ohio are not accidental. In state after state, Republicans have determined that fewer minority voters make it easier for them to win elections. And they have changed voting laws to achieve that goal.
