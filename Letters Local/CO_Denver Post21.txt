Trump and a "rigged" election 
Re: "Trump increases fire against 'rigged' vote," Oct. 16 news story. The media are speculating that Donald Trump's "rigged system" claims are designed to make it look like 
he's not a "loser" come Nov. 9 even though his campaign is sinking due to his own mistakes and character flaws. I submit that he is already a loser because of such claims and his constant whining about how everyone 
is out to get him. It's no different than athletes who lose games because of their own mistakes and then 
blame the referees. That's what losers do --look for black helicopters and engage in conspiracy theories to divert attention from their own shortcomings.

This election is being rigged. It is being rigged by Donald Trump. And every time he opens his mouth, he 
rigs it a little more. George Zepernick, Denver *** My understanding is that if Hillary Clinton wins the presidential election, her victory will be due to voter 
fraud. Well, if Donald Trump wins, does that prove that there is no voter fraud in the U.S.? Mark Fairchild, Fort Collins
