Letters: Trump poses a threat to democracy
ISSUE

CAMPAIGN 2016 Threat to democracyThe latest lie in a campaign of lies has been revealed by the would-be Prevaricator in Chief, and it should surprise no one. It is the 180-degree turn in Donald Trump's position as to whether he will accept the outcome of the election. In the second debate, Trump said he would not challenge the verdict of the people. In the third debate, he said he will look at the situation at the time, which means, "I will only accept the result if I win. If I lose, then it means that the election has been rigged." Once again, he is in direct conflict with running mate Mike Pence, who is assuring the public that his ticket will honor the voters' wishes. Trump recognizes that he is destined to lose, and it will not be his fault. It will be becasue of "crooked Hillary", the "crooked media," and massive voter fraud. Trump poses a danger to our nation whether he is elected president or emerges as a sore loser with an ax to grind.
