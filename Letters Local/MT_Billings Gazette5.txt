Although I usually think of The Gazette as a very good paper, I was extremely disappointed in your decision to endorse Ryan Zinke. 
Throughout his campaign, Zinke has shown himself to be totally out-of-touch with real Montanans, has wildly exaggerated his service record, seems to have little understanding of the real issues facing voters and has parroted ridiculous rumors of "voter fraud." His continuing support of Donald Trump alone demonstrates how unsuitable he is for any elected office and presumes a similar lack of respect for women, minorities, the LBGT Community and Native Americans as Trump continues to display. 
While The Gazette's editorial opinions are generally well thought out, researched and written, this time you've made a serious blunder and done a great disservice to your readers and the state of Montana. Shame on your editorial staff.
