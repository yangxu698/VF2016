Iowa Rep. Norlin Mommsen, R-DeWitt, please stop voter fraud in Iowa. I trust the poll workers in Princeton, they do a great job. I bet that the poll workers in DeWitt also do a great job. Let them do their job and stop wasting our money chasing Republican fantasies of evil voting phantoms. 
Just because one Donald Trump supporter is caught voting twice does not justify making all Iowans procure and then display upon demand their state approved papers before being allowed to cast a vote. 
If a law hinders one person from voting, than that law has institutionalized a crime against all voters. People impersonating others to vote illegally in Iowa is a boogeyman created by former Iowa Secretary of State Matt Schultz to further his political ambition. 
Two-hundred-forty thousand dollars that should have been spent expanding access to the polls for everyone was wasted by Mr. Schultz looking for a crime that did not exist then, and does not exist today. 
Rep. Mommsen, your vote and my vote are no more or less valuable than the least of our neighbors. Be careful that in your quest to protect the value of my vote that you do not denigrate the value of all votes. 
Placing yet another requirement between the people and the polls does not protect democracy. If you allow the state of Iowa to stop just one citizen from participating than it is the state that is guilty of the real crime.
