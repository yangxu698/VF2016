Another allegation of massive voter fraud by the President. If this was somehow true, would this have not turned the election the other way. What undocumented person here, if they could have voted, would have chosen the current president? I am publicly imploring our senators to repudiate such nonsense and show the backbone that Senator Lindsey Graham has shown. Calls to the Senators' offices have gone unanswered. 
If we cannot count on Senators to do the right thing who can we turn to when the lies endanger not just our credibility but our national security. The issues of integrity in our electoral process surely cross party lines and should be something to be proud of. Voter suppression is much more of a serious problem in our country than any alleged voter fraud. Senators McCain and Flake, stand up, speak and condemn such a blatant disregard for the truth.
