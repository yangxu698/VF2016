Trump, invoking voter fraud, thwarts attempts at healing: Letter to the editor
DELAYED HEALING: The last thing our country needs in the wake of the recent elections is more divisive suspicion. When President-elect Trump made the charge recently that millions of fraudulent votes were cast to favor his opponent, he should have also announced his intention to investigate the fraud by starting with an audit of the election.

There isn't anything this country needs less right now than the corrosive effects of half the voters thinking the other half cheated them.
