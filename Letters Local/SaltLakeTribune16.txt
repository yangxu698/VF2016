Letter: Trump and Republicans are undermining democracy
“Poll: Half of Trump backers don’t trust vote count” (Tribune, Oct. 2) reports a poll showing that half of Donald Trump’s supporters believe his lie about widespread voter fraud in the United States. Trump’s claims are an explicit extension of Republican voter ID laws justified by claims of fraud.

The AP article and many others have made it clear that there is virtually no real voter fraud in this country. But, by spreading this claim within the portion of the electorate who are susceptible to conspiracy theories, Trump and the GOP undermine our democracy.

A democracy is not just a set of laws describing a way of governing; it is a tradition of fair play and trust. Confidence in the system cannot be forced by lawsuits, and conspiracy theorists are not influenced by facts. When the people’s confidence is lost it becomes easy to justify lawlessness.

Our traditions of democratic fair play were built slowly over centuries. Now they are being torn down before our eyes by Trump and the GOP. This may be the most lasting tragedy of the 2016 election.
