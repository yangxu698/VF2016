Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump claims that voter fraud is rampant and that our election system is rigged. Could that be why we have a Republican majority in both houses of Congress, why Mitch McConnell is Senate majority leader, why Paul Ryan is Speaker of the House, why there are 31 Republican governors and why a preponderance of state legislatures are dominated by Republicans? It would seem so to me, and I for one want those Republicans to stop rigging elections! Right now!
