The "Artful Dodger" is at it again wasting taxpayers' money investigating unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud while diverting our attention from the important things. His only "proof" is information from his sources, which are never identified. Sound familiar? 
I've been a poll worker in Pima County for several years and know the process well. It would be difficult, if not impossible, for someone to vote twice or for illegals to cast ballots. Early ballots have been under scrutiny but are identified in the voter register, and I can assure you that they only vote once. As for the deceased voting, the Voter Registration Office is notified in a few ways: notification from the state, paid obituaries (which they read), and/or a copy of the death certificate provided by the family or other source. 
Millions of Americans have diligently worked the polls all across this country, protecting our freedom to vote and our democratic process. Don't accept Trump's constant whining or his "alternative truths," better known as lies.
