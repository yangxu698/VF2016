Keep elections clean
To the Editor: America's voter registration system is outdated, inaccurate and riddled with opportunities for voter fraud on a massive scale.

Significant numbers of non-U.S. citizens are voting in American elections, despite laws in all 50 states that prohibit it.

This year, legal efforts by Judicial Watch and others to keep voter rolls clean and to ban ineligible individuals (including illegal aliens) from voting are being challenged in a well-organized and well-funded campaign by the left, which knows that its political fortunes rest on the ability to get illegal voters into voting booths.

Election officials in many states and in both parties continue to routinely fail to clean voter lists. Along with the lack of comprehensive voter ID requirements in many states, potentially millions of votes can be cast by dead people, non-citizens and other disqualified individuals. The left is engaging in dishonest and race-baiting legal attacks on ballot integrity measures. They are challenging voter ID laws in courts across the country. In Virginia, the governor is even attempting to illegally give the vote to ex-felons.

Judicial Watch monitors many states. In November 2014, a team of Judicial Watch lawyers and local volunteers monitored the election for U.S. senator in New Hampshire.

They received a firsthand education in how a voter ID law with loopholes is little better than no voter ID law at all. As a result they contacted state legislators and local media and suggested reform.

The least we can do is to have poll watchers at all voting places.
