Letter: Let voters know of problems
My recent experience with a family member’s mail-in ballot gives me reassurance that our county clerk is doing her part against voter fraud.

The family member had a health issue with their writing hand and they signed their mail-in ballot as best they could. A while later, a notice arrived asking to clarify the signature with the one on file and return it by mail.

I would offer a suggestion to help voters with potential problems. A week before getting the notice the family member checked the website for the status of their mail-in ballot and it showed “received” but no indication of a problem. I hope in the future any problem is indicated on the website to give the voters time to correct it.
