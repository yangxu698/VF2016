I want thank the people who wrote letters to the editor published on Saturday. It was nice to read rational and informative letters. Two of the letters dealt with Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate's attempt to add more red tape to voting. 
A previous attempt to locate voter fraud in Iowa basically demonstrated no significant concern. It cost money to conduct that research and this change would cost money too. While it might not be a lot, it is money that could be spent in better ways. We need more patrol officers on the highway and they are currently cutting money from higher education. There are lots of other places this money could be put to use. 
Paul Pate had an column in the Sunday edition explaining how he perceived the plan. He made a comparison to people locking their doors in low robbery areas indicating we would be locking the door on voter fraud. I would guess in a farm state, more people fail to lock their doors all the time, than commit voter fraud. 
There was a letter about being able to buy insurance from other states. This is one proposal that has been put forward after getting rid of the Affordable Care Act. The writer pointed out how that would expand federal involvement rather than decrease it. I understood we were trying to decrease federal involvement. 
Finally, there was a letter to U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley requesting he maintain his integrity. I second that. 
Thank you for the letters.
