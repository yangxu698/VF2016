Letters: Election Day in Philly is not the same
Voting in Philly has changedI am a Democratic ward leader in West Philadelphia, and I would like to invite former state and federal prosecutor George Parry ("Sometimes there is voter fraud- even in Philly," Friday) to accompany me on my 15-hour Election Day.If he can find any instance bearing the least similarity to what he described in his commentary, I will change my registration to Republican and immediately resign my position. We should not be proud of the sins of the past, but Frank Rizzo has been dead for many years, and many of these practices died with him. Many things have changed since Rizzo was the city's mayor, including on Election Day.

Carol Jenkins, 27th Ward leader, Philadelphia
