Voting booth bull
To the Editor: Governor-elect Chris Sununu is plopping his feet into big brown piles of it even before he gets paid to do so.

His stated intent to end Election Day registration for state voters is wrong-headed thinking, a not-at-all-veiled move toward voter suppression. He has an inadequate explanation. "It's simply about doing things the right way." That doesn't cut it. I guess it all depends on what you think "right" means. Millions of us nationwide say equally simplistically, that same-day voting and registration is "simply about doing things the right way." More to the point is that ongoing studies show overwhelmingly same day registration increases voter participation, and Sununu and his cloudy-eyed cronies also know that increased participation hardly ever favors Republicans.

This is regrettable negative manipulation. Sununu seems to be on the same page of a bad play book currently being written by another official-elect, soon-to-be-President Trump. Trump recently behaved again like a hormonal teenager, tweeting furiously about "serious voter fraud" in several states, including New Hampshire. Ain't happening folks. His are unfounded claims, never supported by facts or figures. State officials stated again recently that "there is no evidence to support the claim of widespread voter fraud by Trump.

Confusingly, Sununu agreed that nothing has come to his attention regarding state voter fraud in the last election.

Trump made an art of lying loudly, repeatedly and consistently during his campaign. He continues to prove daily that his spoiled brat/bully act has not changed at all.
