Letter: Trump plays the media like a cello
President-elect Donald Trump is a master at understanding media. Once again, he has played the media like Yo-Yo Ma plays the cello. After Jill Stein asked for a recount in some states, Trump tweeted that he'd won the popular vote -- if 2 million fraudulent votes weren't counted.

In making yet another outrageous, unsubstantiated claim, the headlines changed from "Stein asks for recount" to "Trump alleges massive voter fraud." Trump skillfully got the story away from recounts to him and to voter fraud.

The media needs to recognize that Trump will, on a daily basis, try to dominate headlines, taking attention away from other key stories. Please get wise. Don't let the incoming president determine the headlines and how stories are covered.
