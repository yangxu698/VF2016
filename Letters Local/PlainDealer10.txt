Democrats leave a big cleanup job
One day after two police officers in Florida are murdered in cold blood, Missouri Democratic Rep. Lacy Clay demands that he be allowed to hang a painting that depicts police as pigs in congressional office space.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, Tweets that hashtags “don’t make America great again.”

Congressional Democrats claim that a man who prosecuted and won a voter-fraud case in Alabama is a racist. What they and the media neglect to point out is the fact that it was black voters on whose behalf Attorney General-designate Jeff Sessions pursued action.

The Democrats, steered by Barack Obama, leave the White House amid an intensified racial divide. They have also widened the canyon between the rich and the poor, and they have managed to destroy America’s standing in the world.

This is the modern Democrat Party.
