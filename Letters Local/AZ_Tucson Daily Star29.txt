Recent passage by the Arizona legislature of a bill placing restrictions on absentee ballot submissions is a troublesome development. Proponents of Arizona's bill said it will prevent the harvesting of ballots by the radical left. In actuality, voter fraud is extremely rare in the United States, Arizona included. 
The much larger problem we face is, in fact, the opposite  voter turnout in the United States is among the lowest of the world's democratic countries. As a child, I saw my parents vote in our neighbor's garage, which had miraculously been transformed to a site of government, run by citizen-neighbors, complete with a huge American flag on the back wall. 
It sounds corny, but I was thrilled  and I still am, even though I vote by mail. It is both a responsibility and a privilege to vote. That is the basis of a democratic government. With a small d. We should all do it. And it's our responsibility to ensure that we can all do it, too.
