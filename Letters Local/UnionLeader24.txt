To the Editor: "I stole it, it's mine!"

Who among us would accept that statement from a thief that stole your property? Would you accept that same statement when it comes to our elections? The Project Veritas tapes (you can see them on Youtube) have provided irrefutable proof that the Democrat Party at the national level is committing widespread acts of violence to intimidate and discredit honest Americans and voter fraud to steal elections from their rightful owners, the American people.

I have met and spoken with the Democrat candidates for the state representative seats in Ward 6. Although I disagree with them regarding the role and scope of government, I found them to be good and honorable people. I'm sure they are just as shocked and angry as I am with the criminality of those senior Democrats who brought shame to their party. I know they will work with me to keep this type of crime out of New Hampshire and to pressure our elected federal representatives, Democrat and Republican, to clean up the cesspool of corruption that Washington D.C. has become.
