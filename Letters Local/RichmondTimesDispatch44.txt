Look at all the Republicans running from Trump. They are afraid if he gets elected they will be exposed for the politically correct do-nothing rats they've turned into. They should all be ashamed for taking advantage of the America I was brought up to love and believe in. If Hillary is elected they are to blame. Shame on the GOP!

This presidential election campaign seems to me to have devolved into a bear-baiting by the Clinton Crime Family and their toadies in the media.

Wow. An Oct. 21 RTD headline: "Wade and McEachin keep discourse civil during debate." Kudos to them! Amazing, politicians who know a debate is supposed to be civil and issues-based!

Has anyone else wondered why only Hillary Clinton's emails were hacked? I would love to see some — or all — of Donald Trump's emails.

Conservative Republicans say government doesn't work. They get elected, control Congress, and prove it.

As evidence mounts of rampant voter registration irregularities and outright fraud, liberals grow increasingly strident in their denunciations of incontrovertible and inconvenient facts. As they close ranks — and bleat in unison "Nothing to see here!" — it must be noted that they run the risk of being labeled voter-fraud deniers.

Before you vote, think of the old saying: If you lie down with a dog, you may get fleas.
