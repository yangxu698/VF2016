Brad's morning edition. Check back this afternoon for more jokes.

* President-elect Donald Trump appears intent on unraveling everything that President Obama did. He just summoned participants in the 2013 Easter Egg Roll back to the White House for a do-over.

* "President-elect Donald Trump." Suddenly, "Nobel Prize winner Bob Dylan" doesn't sound so weird.

* Lady Gaga slammed Melania Trump. There's a sentence I never imagined typing the day after the election a couple years ago.

* In the 2016 elections, the big winner was ... drumroll please ... recreational marijuana.

* The vote counting in parts of Nebraska has been slow. Sure, most of the machines here are not equipped to recognize a vote for a Democrat.

* The day after the election, some people in the Old Market were crying from sheer joy â€“ no, wait, that was the pepper balls.

* Pepper balls were used in the Old Market during an anti-Trump protest. The pepper balls were on loan from OPS, where they're used to control students during English class.

* The Cubs won the World Series and Nebraskans voted to restore the death penalty. Safe to say Gov. Pete Ricketts just had the best week of his life.

* What is this, the best out of 59 City Council votes?

* The Henry Doorly Zoo continues to expand. Eventually our zoo and that hole in the ozone layer will meet in the middle.

* The UNO homecoming royalty titles are now gender-neutral. After hearing this, members of the NU Board of Regents asked, "UNO still has homecoming? Say, how's the football team doing this year?"

* Homecoming at UNO was already unique. Instead of crowns, royalty have parking boots placed atop their heads.

* A toilet museum has opened in Japan. Kearney arch, the attendance gauntlet has been dropped.

* If you are now planning to travel internationally for the first time, you have poor taste.

* There are two new products: toilet paper bearing Donald Trump's likeness and toilet paper bearing Hillary Clinton's image. If someone comes out with congressional toilet paper, it'll be the biggest selling product ever.

* Two people in Florida have been charged with voter fraud. My initial reaction: "Only two?"

* In Arizona a man being pursued by police pulled into the drive-thru at In-N-Out Burger. You think you're impatient for fast service in the drive thru ...
