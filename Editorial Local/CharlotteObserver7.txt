Tweet Commotion

Parody of Aerosmith‚Äôs

‚ÄúSweet Emotion‚Äù

Tweet commotion!

Tweet commotion!

He tweets about things that make us all scared

Tweeting out thoughts that no one should share

He‚Äôs calling out folks, and he‚Äôs done it all year

I can‚Äôt grasp, baby, how we ended up here!

When he reads some drivel from crazed deadbeat

Doesn‚Äôt care who it is ‚Äì if he likes, he‚Äôll retweet!

And it‚Äôs not big news, he a real big liar

So his tweet storms might just set the world on fire!

Tweet commotion!

Tweet commotion!

Is it false or true? Well, we just can‚Äôt tell

Only thing that‚Äôs for sure is he really can‚Äôt spell

And I‚Äôm telling you folks, he‚Äôs a wee bit miffed

He‚Äôs got a tenth of the followers of Taylor Swift!

He tweets about China and voter fraud,

His obsession with SNL‚Äôs a little bit odd

Will someone take away the phone from this man?

Cause he‚Äôll start a world war while he is sitting on the can!
