Voter fraud claims

However, experts say Trump's claim is a fantasy, completely imaginary.

The bipartisan National Association of Secretaries of State said its members are "not aware of any evidence that supports the voter fraud claims made by President Trump.

A couple of years earlier, the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office reported that "no apparent cases of in-person voter impersonation were charged by the Department of Justice's Criminal Division or by U.S. attorneys offices anywhere in the United States from 2004 through July 13, 2014.

Even Trump's own lawyers said there was no 2016 fraud. When the Green Party demanded a Michigan recount, Trump's attorneys filed a counter-brief saying: "All available evidence suggests that the 2016 general election was not tainted by fraud or mistake.

What's wrong with Trump? Is he out of touch with reality? Why is he stirring up a national witch-hunt for nonexistent election cheaters?

A Washington Post commentary says it's part of a GOP strategy to impose ever-tougher restrictions on voting - a deliberate scheme to block balloting by African Americans who generally vote Democratic.

Here's another thought: Maybe it's a distraction, a smoke screen to divert public attention away from problems such as the impending loss of medical insurance by many Americans, or GOP attempts to punish women and girls who end pregnancies or assaults on civil liberties.

Or maybe it is just part of the strategy to sow seeds of mistrust in the electorate in time for the next election.
