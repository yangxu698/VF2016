+ 
A program started by a one-time newspaper photographer to give homeless kids cameras to express themselves has arrived in Aurora. 
+ 
The crowds rolling in to visit Colorado are concentrating on a few specific places (like Denver), so the state tourism board is working on how to attract visitors to places like the Western Slope or the Eastern Plains. As a Yuma native, let me recommend this cool building and Fernando's on Main Street for any would-be tourists. 
+ 
Democratic VP nominee (and harmonica player) Tim Kaine and Dave Matthews hope you "crash into" your local voter registration booth. I am not sorry for that terrible joke.

+ 
Warren Buffett may be currently celebrated as a "Good Billionaire," but the Center for Public Integrity's investigation into his mobile home empire shows that his companies prey on some of the most vulnerable Americans and is a reminder that, really, no one gets to be a billionaire without exploiting someone. 
+ 
In Brooklyn, someone stole a bulldozer and drove it through a park, which is a good excuse to remember the ultimately tragic case of Granby, Colo.'s Marvin Heemeyer. Bonus: Enable your flash player and watch our now-decade-old 3D infographic on the case.

We've also got a pair of stories that, there's no way to sugar coat it, are related to poop. The first is the bizarre tale of "Franken Berry Stool," an actual medical "ailment" spurred by Franken Berry cereal that turned the leavings of American children a technicolor pink that panicked moms around the country in 1971. Round (Number) Two: Four different MIT professors received envelopes of feces in the mail and 
the hunt is on for the poopetrator (their words, not mine).
