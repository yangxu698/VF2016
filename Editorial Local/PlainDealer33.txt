About that voting-booth selfie — well, it’s not legal
Before you post that vote photo or a smiling selfie of you and your ballot, know that in Ohio you’re probably committing a felony.

One that carries at least the possibility of time behind bars.

However, while sharing your ballot — whether on social media or otherwise — is technically illegal, authorities say they won’t be scouring Twitter for #ballotselfie posts in order to snag scofflaws.

That is, unless there’s evidence that the messages have been coerced or part of a pay-for-vote scheme.

The intent of Ohio’s ballot sharing ban, last revised almost 20 years ago, was to prevent voter intimidation, and Tammany Hall-era election fixing, Dan Tierney, a spokesman for Attorney General Mike DeWine said.

Though Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump recently has alleged this year’s contest is rigged, there’s no proof that in Ohio or elsewhere voter fraud is common.

The idea of poll booth secrecy is sacred in many states, though, whether a new generation of voters wants it to be or not.

It harkens back to an era of political election rigging, long before the advent of digital cameras, cell phones or sharing Snaps.

Absent that sort of complaint, “a ballot selfie case might be difficult to prosecute,” Tierney said.
