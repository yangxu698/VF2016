ODDS EVEN SMALLER THAN HIS TINY HANDS
Donald Trump thinks the election is "rigged" against him, but in reality, voter fraud is extremely rare.

According to a recent Loyola Law School study, there were, between 2000 and 2014, only 31 known cases of voter impersonation fraud out of 1 billion votes cast.

That translates roughly to a one in 32,258,064 chance of voter fraud for all the votes cast during that time frame.

Here are five things that are more likely to happen to you than that:

GETTING STRUCK BY LIGHTNING TWICE IN YOUR LIFETIME

You have a one in 9,000,000 chance of getting struck twice by lightning in your lifetime.

A scenario more on par with Trump's claims would be getting struck by lightning twice ... at a Milwaukee Brewers World Series game.

DYING FROM A FLESH-EATING BACTERIA

You have a one in 1,000,000 chance of being consumed by a flesh-eating bacteria, which actually seems unfortunately high.

To put it on the level of Trump's voter fraud claims, you might want to imagine being consumed by a flesh-eating bacteria that you acquired after eating a Trump-brand steak you purchased at The Sharper Image.

BEING FATALLY ATTACKED BY A SHARK

The odds of being the victim of a fatal shark attack are 1 in 11,500,000.

The odds of voter impersonation fraud are probably a little bit closer to being the victim of a fatal sharknado attack.

HITTING THE SAME ROULETTE COLOR 20 TIMES IN A ROW

Gambling odds site Roulette Star says that this outcome has a one in 1,813,778 chance of occurring.

Maybe if you were throwing the dice at the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, it'd be similar to the voting fraud odds. But, oh wait, that's another one of those Trump businesses that doesn't exist anymore!

HITTING A HOLE IN ONE

Actuaries at insurance companies who underwrite hole-in-one contests typically peg this at a one in 12,5000 shot.

To approach to rarity of voter fraud, you'd have probably to be referring to nailing a hole-in-one at a golf course ... on the moon.

Just make sure the contest isn't being run by Donald Trump, because he won't pay you the prize money.
