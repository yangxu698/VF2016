President Donald Trump followed through with campaign rhetoric on Wednesday when he tweeted that he will be ordering an investigation into unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud. 
Depending on what Trump finds, he will "strengthen up voting procedures!" 
Well, he won't find much in Florida, according to reporting that Steve Bousquet and Michael Auslen of the Times/Herald did last year. 
Aside from assurances from the mostly Republican elections officials in the state that fraud was exceedingly rare, there are the public records, which show scant evidence of the existence of voter fraud (typically, in the Trumpian sense, this is fraud where someone casts a ballot more than once or does so even though they aren't eligible to vote). 
During the past two statewide elections, Floridians cast more than 20.7 million ballots. In that period, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement brought 13 voter fraud cases. 
Six ended in guilty pleas, including four convicted felons and one non-citizen who voted illegally and a worker for a political vendor who admitted filing phony voter registration forms. 
A former Hendry County elections supervisor, Lucretia Strickland, pleaded no contest to using her office to tell someone how to vote. 
Two cases were settled before trial. The others are pending or charges were dropped. 
So with Trump, we're left with the question of, "Who are you going to believe, me or your lying eyes?"
