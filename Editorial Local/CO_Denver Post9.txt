Good morning! Is there anything more obviously outdated as the concept of "Cyber Monday?" The idea that the only time people have access to the Internet to shop is when they get back to their desks the Monday after Thanksgiving is laughably obsolete. Yet here we are, awash in "deals" masquerading as excuses to shop. 
Literally the only Cyber Monday deal I care about 
I heard from a few of you about the Instant Pot I talked about in Friday's Roundup. Last night, I made a spicy carrot-ginger soup in it (it was delicious) and this morning they are on sale again for $49, down from $90 (as of this writing. My guess is they will go fast.) Not sure if you want one? Check out this list of 50+ recipes you can make in your Instant Pot to see if it would be up your alley. (This is not a paid sponsorship or anything  though if you buy one using the Amazon link above we do get a tiny little fee to help support the newsletter. I just really want everyone to join the pressure cooker posse). 
If you're heading out into the wild world of online shopping today watch out for fake reviews and make sure you're using the apps that can actually save you money. 
OK, on to the news. 
The Rundown 
+ 
Today's Weather: Snow in the mountains, wind in the city and a 5-day forecast that's actually fitting for the transition between November and December. 
+ 
Today's Editorial: "Careless driving memo a careless policy for prosecutors" Your third-place Denver Broncos "AFC West 1. #Raiders 9-2 
2. #Chiefs 8-3 
3. #Broncos 7-4 4. #Chargers 5-6 Denver would be out of the playoffs if season ended today." Denver Post reporter Cameron Wolfe Folks, that game was intense. If only the entertainment value of games translated to the win/loss column, 
but alas, the Broncos were on the wrong side of the special teams gods (you can watch the bonkers winning field goal here if you're a masochist) last night and found themselves somewhere they haven't been in a long, long time: fighting for their playoff life. 
+ 
Who's to blame for the loss? Mark Kiszla has one name and one name only. 
+ 
A footnote: The Broncos had 6 sacks in the loss, which is all we'd be talking about if they'd won. 
+ 
This guy on the Chiefs scored on a return, a pass and a run, which would be impressive if it wasn't so aggravating. 
Here's a bunch of really great reporting 
Let me tell you a secret about the way newspapers work. Because we like to take holiday weekends just like civilians, we tend to fill those papers with what we call "evergreens," aka great, richly reported stories that are written in advance and held to be released while everyone is stuffing themselves with leftovers. The best part about them is that they are all really, really good stories. To wit: 
+ 
Starting Jan. 1, it's going to take three to tango in Colorado's HOV lanes and Kevin Simpson investigates how it will affect traffic. 
+ 
Our Washington correspondent Mark Matthews on how the survivors of Japanese-American internment camps are troubled by the Trump administration's focus on Muslims. 
+ 
Aldo Svaldi looks at a well-intentioned program designed to connect landlords with homeless tenants to provide housing that is struggling to actually get roofs over people's heads. 
+ 
There are a couple hundred DPS students who regularly practice "Mindfulness" and Monte Whaley investigates the results. 
+ 
Jesse Paul interviewed the two teens who were lost during a winter storm on the Mount of the Holy 
Cross last week. 
+ 
Dave Migoya on the strange (and potentially fraudulent) bedfellows of real estate brokers and title insurers in Colorado. 
+ 
Noelle Phillips on Street2Life screenprinting, a cool print shop that doubles as job training for at risk youths. 
By The Numbers 
That's how old Ann Taylor Cook is. Why do you care? She's the original Gerber baby. Quick Hits 
+ 
Colorado state trooper Cody Donahue was struck and killed by a commercial truck on Friday and the semi truck driver that drifted into the shoulder and killed him could have moved over, according to the arrest affidavit. 
+ 
Hey look, you can cut down your own Christmas tree now. 
+ 
Two people were killed and four were wounded in multiple shootings over the weekend.

Another man fell to his death hiking in Colorado, this time at Palmer Lake. 
+ 
Colorado's Cuban population reacts to the death of Fidel Castro. 
+ 
Dylann Roof, the alleged gunman who killed 9 black parishioners at a church in Charleston last year, will be his own attorney in his federal death penalty case. 
+ 
The Standing Rock Sioux protesters vow to stay on the federal land, despite a warning to leave by Dec. 5. 
+ 
It was a good run, Rapids. Heck of a season. 
+ 
France's Donald Trump is one step closer to that country's presidency. 
+ 
That's the division champion Colorado Buffaloes, thank you very much. 
+ 
If you want your kids to be healthy, let them play in the mud, eat peanuts and play with animals. 
+

+ 
Lots more people are living in their cars near Aspen, according to sheriff's deputies. 
What We're Reading 
+ 
The now-empty Sports Castle will get a spark of life this holiday season. 
+ 
In a scene straight off the cutting room floor of Mr. Robot, unkown hackers have compromised and encrypted dozens of systems of San Francisco's Municipal Transportation Agency and are demanding ransom, forcing the MTA to provide free rides all riders. 
+ 
Imagine if tomorrow, the U.S. government announced that it was pulling all $10 and $20 bills from circulation in order to make sure everyone was paying taxes. That's basically what is happening in India right now, and the government's decision has brought commerce to a virtual standstill. Rather than back out, the prime minister of India has doubled down, saying that the small merchants and businesses that are the most affected by the change should use it as an opportunity to move from a "less-cash" society a "cashless" society. 
+ 
I'm not sure when and where some people got the idea that quotation marks = emphasis, but this gallery of the worst misuses of quotation marks is just infuriating. 
+ 
Watch the video on this story about this incredible market in Thailand and never complain about the foot traffic at the mall ever again. 
Trump Digest 
+ 
Colorado Rep. Ken Buck doesn't think that the president-elect's campaign promise to mass deport undocumented immigrants will get much congressional support (but only because it would cost too much). 
+ 
From former Denver Post reporter Mark Jaffe: "What does a Trump administration mean for Western public lands?" 
+ 
Over the weekend, Trump turned to Twitter to complain about his rivals (again) but this time, he crossed a line by tweeting an enormous, unsupported lie about voter fraud being the only reason he lost the popular vote (by 2 million votes and counting). In case you think I'm being harsh calling it a "lie," I mean it: There is literally no evidence anywhere to back it up. The secretary of state in California, one of the states accused of having "millions" of fraudulent votes, said the accusations are "absurd." 
+ 
Voting rights advocates, including Ari Berman, are worried that these statements are the president-elect setting the stage for a massive regression of voting rights around the country (this is an opinion 
piece, btw, not news, but the ideas are definitely worth considering). 
+ 
Here's your longread on Steve Bannon from the New York Times, including troubling racist language and a history of anger at the elite. No matter what you think of him or Trump, you will definitely know him better after reading that piece.
