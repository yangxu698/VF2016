All eyes on the ballots
Amidst fantastic and fictitious charges by the President of the United States of voter fraud in the millions, a court decision in far northern New York is a victory for transparency in elections and should be celebrated by all, including those in whose heads conspiracy theories dance.

The ruling in Essex County in the Adirondacks by Supreme Court Justice Martin Auffredou establishes that electronic images of ballots cast shall be open for inspection by anyone who wants them. While not binding throughout the state, it is the first time a court has validated that principle.

The scanning machines that New York voters feed their paper ballots into take photographs of every vote cast and store the images as computer files.

While the actual ballots are correctly kept sealed to prevent tampering, those images, as evidence of voter intent in an election, should be open to public scrutiny - much as inspectors pored over hanging chads in Florida in 2000.

At the outset of New York's switch to the new voting technology in 2010, the Daily News invoked the state Freedom of Information Law in the city and elsewhere to get copies of these images.

State Committee on Open Government Executive Director Robert Freeman, New York's guru on all things related to the freedom of information, followed with a pro-disclosure advisory opinion, and several other counties started making the images available.

All was good, until, after a razor-thin election loss, Democrat Bethany Kosmider in Essex County asked for the images a year ago, and the GOP-run county refused.

Kosmider went to court. And she won. Good for her and good for democracy.
