Investigators are looking into a curious case in Harrisonburg, where 18 to 20 voter registrations were submitted in the names of dead people. A voter registration group submitted them. One of the names belonged to the late father of a local judge. Oops.

Republicans pounced on the news, as they say. (That's how news favorable to the GOP is often framed. If a Republican cheats on his taxes, the headline is likely to read: "Republican Cheated on Taxes, Documents Show." If a Democrat cheats on his taxes, the headline is more apt to read: "Republicans Pounce on Claim of Tax Irregularities.")

Republicans pounced on this news because the GOP has been pushing for voter-ID laws. Democrats oppose such laws. They argue that such measures really aim to limit voting by minorities and the poor; actual voter fraud simply doesn't exist, they say.

The Virginia GOP now has evidence to suggest that it does. How much weight that evidence ought to carry, of course, is up for debate. One swallow does not make a summer, as the saying goes, and one incident in Harrisonburg does not necessarily make an ironclad case for a statewide response.

At the same time, Democrats run the risk of underplaying the potential harm here. If one case of fraud has been discovered, then others might have gone undiscovered. Del. Marcus Simon is reaching way too far when he suggests "there's no way any reasonable person could conclude that this was part of an effort to actually cast votes for people that aren't able to cast votes."

"No way"? Really? What else could it have been? An effort to win a free round of golf? An attempt to get into the Guinness Book of World Records? Occam's Razor suggests it was probably neither.
