On Tuesday, we took New Hampshire Democrats to task for floating rumors about "missing ballots" in the razor-thin Senate District 7 race.

Sen. Andrew Hosmer, D-Laconia, conceded the race to Rep. Harold French, R-Franklin, rather than dragging unsubstantiated rumors to the Ballot Law Commission.

Hosmer asked for a recount, and abided by its result. That was the right thing to do. North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory should do the same.

The Republican incumbent currently trails Democratic challenger Roy Cooper by 6,000 votes out of nearly 4.7 million cast. His campaign has lobbed accusations of voter fraud across the state, most of which have been disproved.

McCrory has filed for a recount, which is allowed if the gap stays under 10,000 votes. If he has evidence of fraudulent votes, he should present it. Claims without evidence should be ignored.

Likewise, some dead-end Hillary Clinton supporters are hanging on to the fantasy that she actually won. The same conspiracy theories about hacked voting machines that circulated in Ohio in 2004 have resurfaced this year in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. The dead-enders argue Clinton underperformed in counties with electronic-voting machines, but have no actual evidence of hacking.

Clinton, who gave a gracious concession speech on Nov. 9, has thankfully declined to indulge these groundless conspiracy theories.
