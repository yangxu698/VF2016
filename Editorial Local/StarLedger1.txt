Donald Trump: Master of Illusion | Sheneman cartoon
Donald Trump is not only a billionaire (maybe) and the President of the United States (unfortunately), he's also a master illusionist. At his inauguration he performed feats of magic unparalleled by any world leader since Angela Merkel pulled a coin out of Benjamin Netanyahu's ear when he conjured up a million people out of thin air. Nobody saw these people and their ethereal nature left them undetectable by modern recording devices, but the president swears they were there and you should believe him because he says so.

For his encore he reanimated the dead and sent them to the polls. President Trump has used his mastery of the mystic arts to uncover massive voter fraud taking place right under our noses. Using ancient methods of divination and a third hand story from professional golfer Bernhard Langer, the leader of the free world unveiled a massive plot by uh...someone...to allow undocumented workers and the deceased to vote. This is presumably the reason he thinks he lost the popular vote. Once again, there's no evidence so were just going to have to rely on President Trump's long history of being right about stuff and trust him.

Who are you going to believe, Donald Trump or your own lying eyes? For Chris Christie that answer was easy. When fake news outlets the world round called our commander in chief delusional, professional sycophant Chris Christie jumped to his defense and backed up our future despot's baseless claims without a second thought. For his continued fealty Christie was awarded precisely nothing.
