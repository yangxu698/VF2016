1/7th of your entire life is a Friday, but somehow it's still easy to get excited about it each time it rolls around. 
Me? I'm literally going roller skating tonight to celebrate. You? You can hit a pumpkin celebration with Snoopy, a Halloween parade at Union Station, get cheap snacks from Starbucks or anything else from our list of free & cheap stuff to do (or just check out our whole "Things to Do" section for more). 
Let's. Get. To. It. 
The Rundown 
+ 
Today's Weather: Just, like, incredibly nice weather this weekend. 
+ 
Today's Editorial: "A courageous presidential endorsement by Palmer Ridge student journalists" 
+ 
Today's Poll: "Should ballot selfies be illegal?" (more on that below) 
+ 
Today's Simpsons gif: Oh, Lenny. 
The Great Ballot Selfie Battle of 2016 "We're asking him to retract his statement. It's a threat of prosecution as far as I can tell." Mark Silverstein, ACLU Colorado "I'm pretty sure there wasn't a threat to prosecute voters. It's a friendly reminder that an old state law is 
still on the books." Lynn Kimbrough, spokeswoman for DA Mitch Morrissey First: have you voted yet? If not, check out our voter's guide. Second, if you were planning on showing 
off your ballot through the oh-so-modern-art-form of the selfie, Denver DA Mitch Morrissey has a message: That's against the law. Technically, under that same law, it's illegal to even show your ballot to another person. The ACLU is not having it, especially because just a few weeks ago, a similar ban in New Hampshire was struck down in federal appeals court. Noelle Phillips shakes down both sides in the full story. 
+ 
Meanwhile, things got awkward at what is normally a polite, fun-filled dinner featuring the presidential candidates. 
+ 
The GOP is still trying to figure out what to do if Trump loses and he refuses to accept the election results. 
+ 
Republican Secretary of State Wayne Williams on the "near impossible" chance of voter fraud and "rigging:" "It's not that these events never occur, it's that we catch them." 
Lighting strikes, faulty crossings and stoppage after stoppage: Six months with the RTD A-Line 
If you plan on taking the highly touted A-Line out to DIA this holiday season, you may want a backup plan. When the train works, it's like living in the future, but as John Aguilar writes in this epic analysis of the planning, building and first six months of the train, electrical problems, lightning strikes and a crossing in need of constant babysitting have bruised RTD's once-stellar reputation. 
By The Numbers 
8TD, 8 INT 
That's Brock Osweiler's stat sheet since he betrayed Denver and fled to Houston before the Super Bowl rings were even sized. He's back in town to face the Broncos on Monday Night Football, and the Broncos defense wants a couple of things to happen: interceptions and to "kill" him. (Though it might not be a good idea to get too cocky considering the Broncos just lost to the Chargers, for Pete's sake). 
Ridiculously good deal: Get the gorgeous Denver Post digital replica edition, support local journalism (and get a year of the digital Washington Post) for $1 per week. There is literally no better deal on the internet. 
Crime Corner 
"We don't want anyone retaliating over this. We want everyone to get along on the trails. It's hunting season and we've got trail joggers who have issues with mountain bikers who have issues with hunters and horseback riders. But setting a malicious trap like this, we are not going to take lightly." 
Amber Barrett, Eagle County Sheriff's spokeswoman 
+ 
It happened again. Just before the Colorado High School mountain bike championships kicked off in Eagle, riders found a a board filled with nails buried along a trail. 
+ 
Three times, a Pueblo street gang tried to hire hit men to kill a man only known as "R.M."  and managed to shoot him on two different occasions  but he's still alive and kicking. Don't miss Kirk Mitchell's fascinating full story. 
+ 
The machete-wielding man who was shot on the CU campus in Boulder was "trapped" with officers in the stairwell, according to a new report from Boulder's police chief.

Quick Hits 
+ 
"The raccoon was electrocuted," reads one of the paragraphs in this story that could explain why you might have had to reset the clock on your microwave this morning. 
+ 
The government says that a former NSA contractor committed "breathtaking" thefts of secret information. 
+ 
More of the poor have bank accounts than in 2013, which is a good thing. 
+ 
Ally Bank, in a shameless bit of self promotion, dropped 100 "lucky pennies" around the country (including Denver) that can be traded in for $1,000. 
+ 
I know at least one person who will not need one of those lucky pennies. 
+ 
The "Free the Nipple" lawsuit against Fort Collins can continue, according to a federal judge. 
+ 
2016 is going to be even more memorable for Republican Senate candidate Darryl Glenn. 
+ 
You can buy the top floors of the Daniels & Fisher clock tower building, which would make a pretty 
good base of operations for a mid-level supervillain. 
+ 
Massive rock slide! 
+ 
Trinidad will pay $775,000 to settle two lawsuits alleging that the city's police arrested innocent people based on an unreliable informant. 
What We're Reading 
+ 
Take your time and read this stirring story from Kevin Simpson about a prison program that brings victims and the people who victimized them together for a dialogue. The first four paragraphs will have you hooked. 
+ 
Are you one of those people who worry that the government is tracking you and we're headed for a Minority Report-style tech dystopia? Then you don't need to read this article: "The Feds Already Have Your Face in a Database" 
+ 
While Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were debating Wednesday night, this factory in Shenzhen, China, was busy making latex Donald Trump masks (this is one of the most bizarre photo galleries I've seen in a while). 
+ 
The Fort Collins Coloradoan lays out the history of beer sales at CSU's Hughes Stadium. One interesting note: Hughes was one of the first college stadiums to sell beer, and it was done in 1978 to prevent a ritual by students who tried to line the railing from end zone to end zone with empty beer and wine bottles. 
+ 
Well, this is certainly one way to replace a missing baby Jesus statue's head. 
+ 
The WNBA is super-fun to watch. Last night, in the tiebreaker game of the Finals, the LA Sparks triumphed over the mighty Minnesota Lynx to lift the trophy, but only after an absolutely crazy final two minutes. I'd advocate that Denver get a WNBA franchise, but we can barely support our NBA team as it is. 
+ 
Nintendo has come a long way since the days of the NES, as evidenced by the company's announcement of their new console, the Switch, which looks like an incredibly futuristic way to play video games. 
+ 
To help you wind down from the week, here's a video of a very sharp plane shaving a piece of wood down to less than 1/5th the width of a human hair. Trust me, it's soothing. 
Song of the Day 
Song: "Back To The Life" 
Artist: Spoon 
Sounds like: Perfect "soundtrack to walking confidently into a room" music, complete with handclaps. I'll be playing it in my head while I visualize myself roller skating in slow motion tonight. 
Head over to our Spotify playlist, or, if you don't have a Spotify account, we made you your own special page where you non-Spotify people can listen to the playlist.
