Good morning, folks! It's Tuesday, it's October 18 and in addition to being Alaska Day, it's also my dad's birthday (Happy birthday, dad!). It's a little shocking how much news we've had just since yesterday, so let's boogie. The Rundown 
+ 
Today's Weather: Sunny, but autumnal. 
+ 
Today's Editorial Board Endorsement: "Yes on 3A and 3B: Help DPS close achievement gap and improve facilities" 
+ 
Today's Poll: "Should U.S. voters be concerned that this year's election could be influenced by voter fraud, hacking or other illegal activity?" 
Did a bad cell connection prevent a bomb from going off in Nederland? 
A 3-foot, 6-inch tall 64-year-old man from California was arrested in Chicago after surveillance video tied him to a backpack bomb left outside the Nederland police station that failed to detonate via cell phone. I'm just going to let you sit with that sentence for a bit before encouraging you to read the rest of the story. 
Rally to save Cold Crush 
"There needs to be more black-owned locations like (Cold Crush), not less." 
Ashleigh Blair, 27, Cold Crush patron 
200 patrons, DJs and owners of other clubs gathered outside Cold Crush, the RiNo nightclub hit with a "public nuisance" notice after rapper Boss Goodie was shot and killed outside the venue last week, to protest the closure and film a PSA about what the club means to the community. "White, black, Hispanic  it was the one place that I know that everybody came to," award-winning DJ Squizzy Taylor said. "It 
showed the power of music." 
Boulder teens' Nazi group and the "Trump effect" 
"Teachers have noted an increase in bullying, harassment and intimidation of students whose races, religions or nationalities have been the verbal targets of candidates on the campaign trail." 
From the Southern Poverty Law Center's survey about the effect of the 2016 election on youth 
While one of the students involved in the Facebook chat between Boulder Valley students labeled "4th Reich's Official Group Chat" said that it was "just a bad joke," and police have closed the case and will not be pursuing charges, school officials are taking the chat seriously after the suicide of the group's leader and threats against specific students. Monte Whaley rounded up responses to the group, from the Southern Poverty Law Center to anti-hate organization Not In Our School, who cites the explosive rhetoric that has defined the 2016 presidential election as a source of normalizing this behavior.

Quick Hits 
+ 
"He tried to steer Denver kids away from gangs. Now his family fears gang members gunned him down." 
+ 
Donald Trump continues to claim (in advance) that the election will be "rigged" and both election officials (who point out that voter fraud is incredibly rare) and Hillary Clinton's team are braced for the fallout. 
+ 
This is not the first time Trump has thrown a fit and claimed a system was rigged against him: He said 
the same thing when he didn't win an Emmy. 
+ 
Meanwhile, more and more leaks of emails around Hillary Clinton are pouring out and while none have pointed to anything dastardly, the peek into how the political sausage is made is making some people very uncomfortable. 
+ 
Donald Trump Jr. got blocked from holding an event at a Boulder pizza joint, so he moved his short speech to an empty building. 
+ 
Remember Bernie Sanders? (man, that feels like 10 years ago by now) He was in Boulder yesterday to support Amendment 69, aka "ColoradoCare." 
+ 
The Cleveland baseball team (who have reneged on their promise to "phase out" their racist Chief Wahoo logo) managed to get past an incredibly gory injury to their starting pitcher to beat Tulo's Blue Jays and are now a single win of the World Series. 
+ 
The Denver Archdiocese and the city of Denver announced a new women's shelter for emergency overnight stays and 30-day "decompression" programs to help transition women out of homelessness. 
+ 
The human remains found in the Mesa County desert are those of a 74-year-old missing since 2013. 
+ 
There are better ways to visit Colorado than being extradited from Romania for trafficking Ecstasy. 
+ 
A planned pot shop inside a motel just outside the city border is pitting Winter Park against Grand County. 
+ 
The Avs have now beaten two of the best teams in the league thanks to Gabe Landeskog's gamewinner in the overtime victory over the Stanley Cup champion Penguins. 
+ 
Sure, why not? There's worse on TV. 
+ 
Seriously, the Raiders are probably going to go to Las Vegas and I just can't even wrap my brain around it. 
What We're Reading 
+ 
If you've ever been in downtown Denver, you've seen the Autobuses los Paisanos rolling down Broadway, headed for I-25. The $65 bus to Mexico, writes New York Times correspondent Julie Turkewitz, is "a window into a deeply American feature: The immigrant's split soul." This is a good one folks, don't skip it. 
+ 
A 10-year-old photographer from Confier will soon have his photos featured on skis made in Denver. But that's just the latest feather in the cap for Morgan Wolfers, who already has photos hanging in Joe Biden's crib. 
+ 
Glad to see that in retirement, David Letterman has embraced my patented "Giant Beard to Distract from your Thinning Hair" technique. 
+ 
The NFL has a Very Dumb policy banning its own teams from posting highlights on their Twitter accounts. So the Browns and the Eagles dragged out some old electric football games and improvised on Sunday to hilarious results. 
+ 
This is a great, dumb little joke. 
+ 
Not one, not two, but three different people, including an in-home health care worker and two sheriff's deputies began hallucinating in Oregon. It wasn't a nefarious Russian plot or a gas leak, it was a villain of another kind: The fentanyl patches used by the 78-year-old woman had inadvertently rubbed off on the people trying to care for her. 
+ 
This is a very beautiful and well-timed photo. 
Song of the Day Song: "Sleep A Million Years" Artist: Kathy Heideman Sample lyric: "Please don't frown at me when you could smile / Our eternity is just a while" Sounds like: A twangy, smoky tune about the fleeting nature of life and love, recorded by a wandering bar 
singer in 1976 who stayed in one place just long enough to record a few tracks and then drifted into 
obscurity. Head over to our Spotify playlist, or, if you don't have a Spotify account, we made you your own special page where you non-Spotify people can listen to the playlist.
