"The Newport News Commonwealth's Attorney is looking at 33 potentially fraudulent voter registration forms," reported the Daily Press recently.

That was shortly after this newspaper reported that Vafalay Massaquoi had been arrested for filing fake voter registration forms in Alexandria. He had been working for a progressive advocacy group.

Meanwhile, says The Roanoke Times, "Three federal prosecutors will monitor claims of election fraud and voting rights abuse in the western half of the state this November."

Officials are investigating an incident in Harrisonburg, where the names of 20 dead people showed up on voter applications.

And those are just the Virginia cases. In Iowa recently, a Donald Trump supporter was arrested on charges of voting twice. Two women in Miami were arrested for election fraud around the same time. A voter-fraud investigation in Indiana has spread to 56 counties.

In recent years Republicans have taken a beating for pressing the issue of voter fraud. Critics - including, sometimes, ourselves - have lambasted the party for using an imaginary and nonexistent problem as a pretext to enact ID measures that could suppress minority turnout.

Some Republicans could very well be doing just that. But given the stories cited above, opponents of ID measures should stop claiming the problem of voter fraud isn't real.
