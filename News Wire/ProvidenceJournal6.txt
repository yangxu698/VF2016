Fact-checking press secretary Spicer

Spicer: "He won overwhelmingly with 306 electoral votes, the most since any Republican since Reagan."

The facts: Not the most since Reagan, and not an overwhelming victory by history's standards. You only have to go back to George H.W. Bush to find a bigger Republican Electoral College winner. Bush captured 426 electoral votes in 1988, or 79 percent, well ahead of Trump with 306 electoral votes, or 57 percent. Reagan achieved true blowouts, winning 489 electoral votes (91 percent) in 1980 and 525 (97.6 percent) in 1984.

The broader context: Trump's victory ranked 46th out of the 58 elections since the nation's founding, far from the "landslide" that Trump himself has often claimed.

Spicer: "I think there's been studies. There's one that came out of Pew in 2008 that showed 14 percent of people who voted were noncitizens."

The facts: First, Spicer mixes up studies. Second, he misrepresents the conclusions.

The Pew study, released in 2012 and based in part on 2008 results, was about outdated or otherwise inaccurate voter registration records, not about votes illicitly cast by noncitizens. David Becker, an author of that study, tweeted Tuesday that voting integrity in 2016 was "better in this election than ever before."

The issue of noncitizen voting actually was examined in a 2014 study by two Old Dominion University professors. Their "best guess" was that 6.4 percent of noncitizens voted in 2008 and 2.2 percent in 2010. Even those modest numbers were sharply disputed by other academics because of the study's methodology.

The broader context: No evidence of significant voter fraud surfaced from the 2016 election, despite plenty of digging.
