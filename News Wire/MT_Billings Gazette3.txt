President-elect Donald Trump got busy on Twitter again during the holiday weekend, tweeting a stream of baseless claims of voter fraud, indicating that the Hillary Clinton campaign's involvement in an election recount was hypocritical. 
Trump, who himself suggested that he would not concede the election during the campaign if he had lost, used his Twitter account to declare that "nothing will change." He also reiterated that Clinton had already conceded the election. 
Trump, however, also effectively offered his own support for the recount, providing a seemingly baseless allegation that he would have won the popular vote "if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally." 
In another tweet, he said without evidence that there was "serious voter fraud" in Virginia, New Hampshire and California. 
California Secretary of State Alex Padilla, a Democrat charged with ensuring the state's vote goes smoothly, called Trump's claims "absurd" and "reckless." 
"It appears that Mr. Trump is troubled by the fact that a growing majority of Americans did not vote for him," Padilla said in a tweet from his personal account. "His unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud in California and elsewhere are absurd. His reckless tweets are inappropriate and unbecoming of a President-elect."
