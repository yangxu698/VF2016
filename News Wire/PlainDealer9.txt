Newswatch - WASHINGTON, D.C. Trump claims millions voted illegally
Days after being sworn in, President Donald Trump insisted to congressional leaders invited to a reception at the White House that he would have won the popular vote had it not been for millions of illegal votes, according to people familiar with the meeting. Trump has repeatedly claimed, without evidence, that widespread voter fraud caused him to lose the popular vote to Hillary Clinton, even while he clinched the presidency with an electoral college victory. Two people familiar with the meeting said Trump spent about 10 minutes at the top of the gathering with Republican and Democratic lawmakers rehashing the campaign. Trump also told them that between 3 million and 5 million illegal votes caused him to lose the popular vote. The claim is not supported by any verifiable facts, and analyses of the election found virtually no confirmed cases of voter fraud, let alone millions.

Abortion restrictions reinstated

President Donald Trump reinstated a policy Monday that originated in the Reagan era, prohibiting the granting of U.S. foreign aid to health providers abroad who discuss abortion as a family-planning option. U.S. law already prohibits the use of U.S. taxpayer dollars for abortion services anywhere, including in countries where the procedure is legal. But Trump’s order takes the prohibition further: It freezes funding to nongovernmental organizations in poor countries if they offer abortion counseling or if they advocate the right to seek abortion in their countries. The freeze applies even if the organizations already use other sources of funding for these services. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence stated their opposition to abortion during the presidential campaign. Trump had signaled his intent to make the order one of his first acts as president, which pleased anti-abortion activists at home.

Inaugural declared day of patriotism

President Donald Trump has officially declared the day of his inauguration a national day of patriotism. Trump’s inaugural address on Friday frequently referred to patriotism as the salve that would heal the country’s divisions. “When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice,” Trump said from the steps of the Capitol after being sworn in as president. Later that day, Trump’s press secretary, Sean Spicer, said that naming a national day of patriotism was among the executive actions that Trump took in his first few hours as president. On Monday, the paperwork was filed with the federal government declaring officially that January 20, 2017 — the day of Trump’s inauguration — would officially be known as the “National Day of Patriotic Devotion.”

Writer is out over Barron Trump Tweet

Katie Rich, a “Saturday Night Live” writer who mocked Barron Trump, the youngest child of President Donald Trump, in a Tweet during Friday’s inaugural festivities, has been suspended from the late-night comedy show. Rich was suspended immediately after the Tweet, and will be suspended indefinitely, according to a source familiar with the matter but not authorized to comment publicly. In the original message, Rich predicted that 10-year-old Barron would become “the country’s first homeschool shooter.” The message was soon deleted by Rich, who also temporarily deactivated her personal Twitter account, but not before it drew widespread condemnation online. On Monday, Rich apologized for the initial Tweet, calling it “insensitive.” “I deeply regret my actions & offensive words. It was inexcusable & I’m so sorry,” said Rich, a veteran of Chicago’s Second City who joined the NBC comedy show in 2013.

Spanish-language website taken down

President Donald Trump, whose relationship with Latinos already is frosty, has taken down the White House’s Spanish-language website, and in the process may have kicked off another fiery English-only debate. It was unclear Monday whether the elimination of Spanish was permanent; White House press secretary Sean Spicer did not directly address the use of Spanish during his briefing for reporters. Pages dealing with LGBT issues, climate change, health care and civil liberties also disappeared.

Trump orders federal hiring freeze

President Donald Trump instituted a government wide hiring freeze Monday, signing an executive order that he said would affect all employees “except for the military.” Trump had pledged to halt government hiring as part of his campaign’s “Contract with the American Voter,” which he framed as part of a larger effort to “clean up corruption and special interest in Washington, D.C.” The move sparked an outcry from federal employee unions.
