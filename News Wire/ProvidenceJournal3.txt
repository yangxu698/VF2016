RI secretary of state speaks out

Rhode IslandSecretary of State Nellie Gorbea wants to assure voters — and new President Donald J. Trump — that "widespread voter fraud" did not cost him the votes he lost to Hillary Clinton in Rhode Island.

Responding to Republican Trump's call for an investigation of the alleged fraud he blames for his national popular vote loss to Clinton by more than 2.9 million votes, Gorbea issued this statement:

“As Rhode Island’s Secretary of State, I am working hard to ensure that our elections are fair, fast and accurate. Over the past two years Rhode Island has taken steps to improve the security of our voting systems so that Rhode Island voters can trust the integrity of every vote."

In Rhode Island, Democrat Clinton beat Republican Trump 54.4 percent to 38.9 percent with 252,525 votes to his 180,543 votes, and single digit tallies for each of the other candidates on the ballots.
