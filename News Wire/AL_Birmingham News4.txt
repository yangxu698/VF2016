WASHINGTON  The Supreme Court declined Texas officials appeal in the ongoing battle over the states voter identification law Monday, meaning an earlier decision by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which found the law violates the Voting Rights Act, will stand. 
The Republican-backed voter ID law, which first went into effect in 2013, has been making its way through a long court battle ever since. Most Texas Republicans, including Gov. Greg Abbott, say that the law is necessary to prevent voter fraud. 
Last summer, the judges on the 5th Circuit noted that out of more than 20 million votes cast in Texas in the last decade, there had only been four instances of possible fraud of the type the law was written to address. The laws opponents argue that the main goal of requiring voter ID is to prevent black and Hispanic voters from casting a ballot. 
Although the Supreme Court declined to take up the case, Attorney General Ken Paxton said he remains optimistic that the justices will eventually conclude that the voter ID law is not discriminatory. 
Chief Justice (John) Roberts made it very clear that the case will be an even stronger posture for Supreme Court review after further proceedings in the lower courts, Paxton said, adding that he would continue to fight for the law in district court, the 5th Circuit, and, if necessary, the Supreme Court again.
