A woman in Iowa has been arrested on suspicion of voting twice in the general election, court and police records show. 
Terri Lynn Rote, a 55-year-old Des Moines resident, was booked Thursday on a first-degree charge of election misconduct, according to Polk County Jail records. The charge is considered a Class D felony under Iowa state law. Rote was released Friday after posting $5,000 bond. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for Nov. 7. 
The Des Moines Register reported that Rote is a registered Republican who cast two ballots in the general election: one at an early voting ballot at the Polk County Election Office and another at a county satellite voting location, according to police records. 
Rote told Iowa Public Radio that she cast her first ballot for Donald Trump but feared it would be changed to a vote for Hillary Clinton. 
"I wasn't planning on doing it twice --it was spur-of-the-moment," Rote told the radio station. "The polls are rigged." 
Polk County Auditor Jamie Fitzgerald told the Register that it was the first time in 12 years he could remember having to report possible voter fraud.
