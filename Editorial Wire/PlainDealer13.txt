What we know, and don’t know about Russian role
The swirl of revelations and allegations about Russian involvement in the U.S. presidential election, which has been building since summer, can be difficult to keep straight.

For example, though analysts often say that Russia “hacked the election,” this shorthand refers to something much subtler than altering the vote itself — just one of many points of growing confusion. What follows is a guide to what is known and is not, and to separating fact from misconception.

What was Russia’s role in the election?

* 3 Russian security agencies infiltrated Democratic National Committee email servers last year and again this spring, according to U.S. intelligence assessments and several independent security firms.

* 3 This summer, intermediaries linked to the Russian government passed the emails to WikiLeaks and to an anonymous WordPress blog called Guccifer 2.0. Those outlets released the emails publicly, generating weeks of unfavorable coverage of Clinton’s campaign.

* 3 Initially, many analysts believed that Russia’s goal was to sow confusion and undermine Americans’ faith in their government — a common Russian tactic — rather than to steer the election’s outcome.

* 3 However, after the election, the CIA concluded that Russia had released the emails with the goal of bolstering Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. The CIA has not said that Russia’s involvement decided the election’s outcome.

Was the election itself hacked?

* 3 There is no evidence that hackers, from Russia or elsewhere, tampered with the vote tallies.

* 3 Trump has said there was widespread voter fraud that favored Clinton, and some liberal commentators have suggested that the election was hacked. Independent analysts say there is overwhelming evidence against both claims.

* 3 A widely circulated New York magazine article reported that two voting experts had urged Democrats to push for a recount, on fears that hackers had manipulated the vote.

* 3 The White House and election officials have said the vote shows no sign of tampering and accurately reflects popular will.

Did Russia swing the election for Trump?

* 3 It is impossible to say for sure. Because the email leaks unfolded over weeks, and concurrently with many other election dramas, polls cannot easily isolate the impact of the leaks.

* 3 Trump won three crucial Midwestern states by very small margins. So even if the leaks swung only a small percentage of votes, that could have been enough to change the election outcome.

* 3 But this same logic applies to dozens of factors, including the FBI’s late-stage investigations related to Clinton’s private email server.

Evidence suggests that voters freely selected Trump on Election Day in sufficient numbers for him to win the presidency under the Electoral College system. But that does not diminish the seriousness of Russia’s intervention in the election.

Why does the CIA think the way it does?

* 3 Russia also hacked the Republican National Committee’s computers but declined to release its emails, giving credence to theories that Moscow actively favored the party’s candidate.

* 3 Trump has repeatedly promised to realign the United States with Russia and has praised its president, Vladimir Putin. Many in Moscow view Clinton as hostile to Russia.
