CHRISTIE ‘SURE' OF FRAUD IN 2016 VOTE
Gov. Chris Christie said he is "sure" there was voter fraud in last year's presidential race.

Appearing on his monthly call-in radio show "Ask the Governor" on Wednesday night, Christie was askedif he thought there had been voter fraud as President Donald Trump claimed during the 2016 presidential contest.

"I am sure there was," Christie said.

Tuesday, Trump and his press secretary, Sean Spicer, both falsely claimed that 3 million to 5 millionpeople illegally cast ballots, denying Trump a victory in the popular vote in hisshowdown with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

Christie admitted that there was no evidence to support his own claims, but insisted that they were true.

"How you quantify it, I don't know," Christie said. "But we know it's there."

New Jersey's election system is overseen by the state Division of Elections under Lt. Gov Kim Guadagno, who also serves as secretary of state.Guadagno said,"Nothing about voter fraud has been brought to my attention," but noted that "those types of allegations are generally handled by the county clerks and county boards of elections."
