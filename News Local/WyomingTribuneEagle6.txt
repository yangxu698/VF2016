Secretary of State's Office says Wyoming voting system not rigged

Wyoming Secretary of State Ed Murray and the leadership of the County Clerks Association of Wyoming want to reassure Wyoming voters that the election process is not rigged.

The announcement came Thursday after Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump suggested again that the general election could be rigged.

"Recent comments that an election could be rigged gives Wyoming's 23 county clerks and myself, as chief election official, the opportunity to assure our citizens of the integrity of our voting process," Murray said. "Wyoming's county clerks and I are able to state categorically that Wyoming's election process will not be 'rigged' or 'hacked.'"

Murray's office cited several safeguards that are in place to prevent fraud.

In addition, all voters must attest that they are citizens and eligible to vote.

Wyoming's voter registration system interfaces with data from the Wyoming Departments of Transportation, Health, Corrections, and the Division of Criminal Investigation to prevent voter fraud, such as votes cast by deceased persons. If voter fraud were to ever occur, those individuals would be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, Murray said in the release.

"The citizens of Wyoming will decide the winners and losers in this election - fair and square," said Carbon County Clerk Gwynn Bartlett, president of the County Clerks Association of Wyoming. "Wyoming's voting process is protected from beginning to end. There are many safeguards that the Secretary of State's Office and county clerks have put in place to maintain the integrity of each person's vote."
