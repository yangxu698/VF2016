These three years have been defined by significant substantive accomplishments on one key policy issue after another. Those achievements are not victories for one party or another. They are victories for Virginia. ...

When I took office, Virginia's unemployment rate was 5.4 percent. Over the course of this administration it fell to as low as 3.7 percent, which represented the steepest decline in any governor's term in 32 years.

One of the proudest moments of my life came on April 22nd of last year when I stood on the steps of this Capitol and brought Virginia into line with 40 other states that restore the civil rights of people who made mistakes and served their time.

That action was greeted by cheers from some corners of this room and lawsuits from others. But the principles of redemption and second chances are essential to a healthy society and I was proud to fight for them. ...

And tonight I am proud to announce that, thanks to those efforts, we have given more than 127,000 Virginians a second chance at citizenship since I took office.

One result of our challenged mental health system is that too many individuals who suffer from behavioral health disorders wind up in jail, where there are not enough resources to properly care for them. To solve that problem, I have proposed legislation and funding to expand mental health screenings in local and regional jails.

As we work to prevent future tragedies, I have proposed legislation giving the Virginia Board of Corrections the authority to investigate deaths in Virginia jails so that its role is clear if one does occur.

We cannot fully reform our mental health system without tackling the massive epidemic Virginia and states across the nation are confronting with respect to heroin and prescription drugs. ...

My budget proposal includes $5.3 million for increased substance abuse disorder services and new tools to prevent overdose deaths.

As we wait for Congress to determine the future of the Affordable Care Act, we should remember that Medicaid expansion offers us an additional $300 million per year to strengthen our behavioral health system.

As you know, the budget I submitted gives the governor the authority to expand Medicaid if an enhanced federal match is available after October 1, 2017.

And even if that is not the case, we should all agree that we have a responsibility to help as many people as we can access health care. Virginians elected us to solve problems. 400,000 people living without health care is a problem. We should never stop seeking ways to solve it.

We can build on our progress reforming our criminal justice system with smart policy choices this session.

One way to accomplish that goal is to increase the commonwealth's threshold for felony larceny from $200 to $500. Right now Virginia is tied with New Jersey for 50th out of 50 for the most punitive felony threshold in the nation. Let us work to bring Virginia up from the bottom of the rankings on this important issue.

Another step we can take to protect Virginians' economic productivity is to limit the number of people whose driver's licenses are suspended due to unpaid court costs and non-driving related offenses.

Suspending people's driver's licenses limits their ability to work, which only makes it more difficult to earn the money to pay off their debt and build better lives.

Our state workforce is the best in America, and they deserve more compensation than they currently receive. I am proud that we have worked over the past three years together to pass two such salary increases.

While language in our budget restricted the second raise due to our revenue shortfall, the budget offers Virginia's teachers, state employees and state-supported local employees a 1.5 percent bonus as a stopgap until our revenue conditions allow for a permanent increase in base pay.

If our revenue conditions do improve, I am eager to work with you to prioritize a more significant pay increase.

Since it was created nearly 22 years ago, the Virginia Economic Development Partnership has served as our commonwealth's primary economic development driver. There are many hard-working men and women at VEDP, but, as a recent JLARC report identified, the organization is in need of stronger management and accountability.

Reforming VEDP should not be a partisan issue. Its problems have persisted over the terms of five previous governors and 21 General Assembly sessions. I am ready to work with you to ensure that Virginia's economic development infrastructure is delivering the return on investment that taxpayers have a right to expect.

***

Any effort to build a stronger economy and society must begin with giving as many Virginians as possible a full voice in that society. ...

When it was passed, our photo ID law made it significantly harder for many Virginians to vote, without any evidence that voter fraud is a problem in Virginia. And so this year I hope we will repeal it.

***

As we begin our work together this session, our neighbor North Carolina remains mired in a divisive and counterproductive battle over laws its legislature passed that target the rights of LGBT citizens. As we have seen in that state and others, attacks on equality and women's health care rights don't just embarrass the states that engage in them — they kill jobs. ...

I want to make it very clear that I will veto any legislation that discriminates against LGBT Virginians or undermines the constitutional health care rights of Virginia women.
