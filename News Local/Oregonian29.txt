Donald Trump, without evidence, claims millions voted illegally for Hillary Clinton
President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday alleged that there were "millions of people who voted illegally" for Hillary Clinton without evidence as an audit of the election results is set to begin in Wisconsin.

Trump took to Twitter shortly after 2 a.m. EST, quoting Clinton's rebukes of statements the president-elect made in the weeks leading up to the election when he claimed the results would be rigged in the former secretary of state's favor.

In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally

In a series of tweets, Trump claimed he had, in fact beaten Clinton in the popular vote despite credible reports that the former secretary of state leads the president-elect by more than 2 million in that category.

The Democrats, when they incorrectly thought they were going to win, asked that the election night tabulation be accepted. Not so anymore!

Trump's comments drew sharp rebukes from critics, most of whom concede that although there's no evidence of widespread tampering with voting machines in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, there's also no harm in auditing the results.

Green Party nominee Jill Stein spearheaded the effort to raise the $7 million necessary to audit results in the three battleground states. Should the process somehow find Clinton had actually won those electoral votes, she'd end the contest with 278, handing her the keys to the White House.

Most analysts expect the audits won't change the final results. And the most well-documented cases of voter fraud in the days leading up to the election weren't perpetrated by Democrats, but rather Trump supporters who were afraid the contest would be stolen.

Trump has also -- once again, without evidence -- claimed there was "serious voter fraud" in Virginia, New Hampshire and California.
