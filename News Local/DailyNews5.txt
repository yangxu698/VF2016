Prez labels own team frauds
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S "voter fraud" investigation could hit awfully close to home.

"I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states," Trump tweeted Wednesday - apparently unaware his daughter Tiffany Trump, chief White House strategist Stephen Bannon and Treasury Secretary pick Steven Mnuchin were all reportedly registered to vote in two states during the 2016 election.

It is not illegal to be registered to vote in more than one state - just to vote in more than one. There's no indication the Trump trio did so.

Trump reportedly told congressional leaders Monday that part his assertions about massive voter fraud stemmed from a story told by golfer Bernhard Langer, a German citizen.
