Poll goons' addled plan
WHITE NATIONALISTS and armed vigilantes say they intend to monitor polling sites on Election Day - and carry out dirty tricks like handing out booze and pot - in an effort to depress vote turnout in the cities.

The hate groups appear to be responding to Donald Trump's fearmongering over widespread voter fraud and an election that is "rigged" in Hillary Clinton's favor.

The alt-right website The Right Stuff announced plans to mobilize thousands of poll-watchers, install video cameras at voting sites in Philadelphia and dole out marijuana and liquor in the "ghetto" to keep potential voters from casting their ballots, according to Politico.

Trump has specifically cited Pennsylvania when touting fears of voter fraud, saying he could lose the hotly contested state if "in certain sections of the state they cheat."

"We are organizing poll watchers in urban areas to cut down on the most traditional type of voter fraud," a representative for The Right Stuff, who would not be identified by name, said in a statement to Politico.

Voter fraud is uncommon. A Loyola Law School study cited by the Southern Poverty Law Center found that there were only 31 cases of potentially fraudulent votes out of more than 1 billion ballots cast between 2000 and 2014.
