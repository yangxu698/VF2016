National election hotline launched
Georgia is one of 26 states being tracked by on-the-ground volunteers for the Election Protection coalition of civil rights and voting access groups.
The coalition last week officially launched a national toll-free hotline for voters to ask questions or report problems.
The effort comes as Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp has traveled the state to tout the accessibility and security of elections here this year. The state in 2010 launched a "Stop Voter Fraud" website and complaint submission form, which are accessible via the Secretary of State Office's homepage( www.sos.ga.gov). It also sponsors its own voter fraud hotline at 877-725-9797.
Kristen Clarke, the president and executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said interest in Georgia was heightened over voting access issues. She also said Georgia was one of several states where late changes were made to voter rules ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election that some voters may not know about.
In Georgia's case, officials recently agreed to temporarily suspend an exact matching requirement for voter registration forms, potentially allowing tens of thousands of previously rejected applicants onto the rolls ahead of Election Day. The agreement came amid an ongoing federal lawsuit.
Callers to the 866-OURVOTE hotline can ask questions related to their state's rules or status, or they can report problems.
