With roughly a month to go before Election Day, General Assembly Republicans say they will hold a meeting next week to discuss concerns about the state's election system and recent reports of alleged voter fraud.

The joint meeting of the House of Delegates and Senate elections committees will be held next Thursday at the Capitol, Republicans announced Thursday.

In prepared statements, Sen. Jill Holtzman Vogel, R-Fauquier, and Del. Mark L. Cole, R-Spotsylvania - who chair the respective committees - said local voter registrars have raised several concerns about the state's preparedness.

"Registrars are concerned about the status of the Department of Elections VERIS system, the backlog of voter registrations and absentee ballot applications, and a lack of support or guidance from the department on key issues," Cole said.

The meeting agenda also calls for an update on "Election Integrity."

Republicans have called attention to an investigation underway in Harrisonburg after nearly 20 dead people were registered to vote.

At a State Board of Elections meeting this week, Virginia Commissioner of Elections Edgardo Cortes defended the system's safeguards against fraudulent registrations.

No charges have been filed in the Harrisonburg case.
