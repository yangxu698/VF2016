Nukes 'scary,' world 'a mess'
PRESIDENT TRUMP admitted that having access to the country's nuclear arsenal is "very, very scary," even to him.

In his first televised one-on-one interview, Trump defended his belief in massive voter fraud, said torture works and called the world "a total mess."

And he said receiving the nuclear codes was a sobering experience.

"When they explain what it represents and the kind of destruction that you're talking about, it is a very sobering moment, yes," Trump told ABC's David Muir. "It's very, very scary, in a sense."

In the wide-ranging interview, conducted at the White House, Trump defended his beliefs on torture, voter fraud, and called violence in Chicago "worse than the Middle East."

Trump defended his speech last weekend at CIA headquarters in which he railed about the media and crowd size.

"In fact, they said it was the biggest standing ovation since Peyton Manning had won the Super Bowl, and they said it was equal," Trump said.

When Muir asked if banning immigration from majority-Muslim countries might create more "anger" toward the U.S., the President turned morose.

"There's plenty of anger right now," he said. "How can you have more? The world is a mess. The world is as angry as it gets."
