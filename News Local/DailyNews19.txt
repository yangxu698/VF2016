I'll accept vote, if I win, that is
DONALD TRUMP said he'll accept the election results of Nov. 8 - but only if he's on his way to the White House.

"I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters and to all of the people of the United States that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election - if I win," he proclaimed Thursday with a grin in an Ohio rally, doubling down on his previous refusal to say he'd participate in a peaceful transition of power that is the bedrock of American democracy.

The GOP nominee claimed that Hillary Clinton is seeking to rig the election before arguing that he's "being asked to waive centuries of legal precedent designed to protect the voters."

And he continued to undermine voters' trust in American democratic institutions, claiming that 1.8 million dead people are registered to vote, "and some of them vote," after claiming that Clinton is "truly capable of anything, including voter fraud."

Those comments at the debate that he would not accept the election results are alarming politicians of all stripes.

Arizona Sen. John McCain issued a stinging open letter warning Trump to show "respect" to America and accept the will of the people if he loses.

"I didn't like the outcome of the 2008 election. But I had a duty to concede, and I did so without reluctance," McCain, a Republican, wrote.

President Obama, campaigning for Clinton in Florida, said Trump's comments are "not a joking matter."
