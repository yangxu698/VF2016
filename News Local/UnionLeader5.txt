"Don't fall for it," Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-NH, implores.

She took to President Donald Trump's favorite medium, Twitter, to contend he's drumming up false claims to set the stage to restrict voter rights.

Trump called for an investigation into voter fraud Wednesday, ignoring a flurry of media reports that there wasn't any, or that there is no evidence of major wrongdoing on election day.

New Hampshire reaction cuts along some partisan lines. Edward Mosca, former legal counsel for the New Hampshire House of Representatives, heralded Trump's call for a probe, and he said let it begin with the Granite State â€” even though the Attorney General's Office says there was no major voter fraud in 2016.

GOP national committeewoman Juliana Bergeron said some fraud does exist in every state, but she says it was not a factor in Trump's failure to win New Hampshire on Nov. 8.

Press coverage of Trump's call for an investigation, despite his administration not producing any smoking gun, rivals the controversy over attendance at his inauguration and the 45th President has not been in office a week. J.P. Marzullo, a former state GOP vice chairman, says Trump's getting down to business.

"He's doing a lot of things he said he'd do," he said. "I just wish he'd stop talking about crowd size."
