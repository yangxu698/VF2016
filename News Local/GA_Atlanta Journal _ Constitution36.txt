The DNC says that poll watchers would equate to voter intimidation, USA Today reported.
The DNC wants to enforce a consent agreement between both sides reached in 1981. In that case, armed off-duty police and sheriff's deputies wore "Ballot Security Task Force" arm bands during the New Jersey gubernatorial race. They were stationed outside polls in predominantly minority areas, USA Today reported.
The suit claims the RNC has not sufficiently denied Donald Trump's claims that the election is rigged, CNN reported.
"Trump has falsely and repeatedly told his supporters that the November 8 election will be 'rigged' based upon fabricated claims of voter fraud in 'certain areas' or 'certain sections' of key states," DNC attorneys wrote in the complaint. "Unsurprisingly, those 'certain areas' are exclusively communities in which large minority voting populations reside."
The DNC is asking the courts to issue sanctions against the RNC, CNN reported.
The RNC has not responded to the suit.
