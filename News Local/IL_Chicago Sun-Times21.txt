The flurry of voter fraud and intimidation allegations and counter allegations swirling through Kankakee County has caught the attention of state and federal officials. 
A day after Kankakee officials announced an investigation into voter fraud, including allegations that individuals from Chicago" were offering gifts in exchange for votes, the top federal attorney for central Illinois and Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan paid the city a visit. 
Kankakee County States Attorney Jamie Boyd disclosed the investigation on Tuesday, sparking a war of words and accusations between the Illinois Democratic Party and the Illinois Republican Party. 
Republicans tried to keep the heat on Wednesday, launching a voter fraud hotline. 
The probe is centered on a hotly contested race between Democratic State Rep. Kate Cloonen and her Republican challenger Lindsay Parkhurst. The race is among the most expensive House races this election cycle. 
While Boyd said the investigation was opened in response to allegations that gifts were offered to voters by individuals from Chicago in exchange for votes for Cloonen, presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and others, union leaders and former Democratic officials turned the tables, saying instead that voters had been harassed and intimidated by local officials, including the states attorneys office, sheriffs office and county clerk.
