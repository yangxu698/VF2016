No widespread vote fraud: Ryan
House Speaker Paul Ryan says the election was "pretty fair," adding that he hasn't seen any evidence of widespread voter fraud.

Ryan's comments come as President-elect Donald Trump is alleging that "millions of people voted illegally" and 2016 Green Party nominee Jill Stein is launching a recount effort.

The Wisconsin Republican was interviewed Tuesday morning by WCLO radio in Janesville, his hometown.

During the interview, he said he didn't see "any evidence of systemic fraud." He also called Stein's call for a recount "nothing more than a ridiculous fundraising and publicity stunt."

Trump has claimed, without evidence, that he "won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally."

Stein has raised millions of dollars to pay for a recount in Wisconsin and is also calling for recounts in Pennsylvania and Michigan. Trump won all three by fairly narrow margins.

During Tuesday's interview, Ryan also laid out his priorities for Congress once Trump takes office. Those priorities include "reforming our tax code," which he called a "special interest cesspool," as well as "Obamacare relief."

Calling the Affordable Care Act a huge "government takeover," Ryan repeated calls for it to be replaced, but said he supports certain aspects of it - such as letting parents keep their children on their health insurance until age 26 and making sure that patients with pre-existing conditions can get access to affordable health care.

Trump expressed support for those provisions shortly after the election.

"A Better Way," the plan laid out by Ryan and the House GOP in June, also includes provisions that aim to protect patients with pre-existing conditions and allow dependents up to age 26 to stay on their parents' plan.
