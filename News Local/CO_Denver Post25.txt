Should voters be concerned about next month's election being rigged, as Donald Trump has claimed? And what about Russians hacking state election systems? 
Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has said numerous times that he believes the news media and the Democratic Party are conspiring to commit vast election fraud. "The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary  but also at many polling places 
 SAD," Trump tweeted on Sunday. 
Other Republicans, including party leaders and Trump's running mate, Mike Pence, have sought to combat those claims. 
As for hacking concerns, the FBI warned state election officials earlier this year of possible attempts to hack state election systems after breaches in Arizona and Illinois. The likely culprits, according to The Washington Post, were agents of the Russian government. Experts suggested that there was no concern that the hackers could affect election results. 
And last week, federal investigators said they believe Russian hackers were behind cyberattacks on Florida's election system.
