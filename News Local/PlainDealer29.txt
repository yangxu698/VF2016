What you need to know about an Ohio federal judge's order on voter harassment
Clerk of Courts

CLEVELAND, Ohio — An order released Friday afternoon by a federal judge in Cleveland overseeing a voter-intimidation lawsuit brought against Donald Trump and Republicans reiterates that people must obey Ohio's law when going to polling places.

U.S. District Judge James Gwin's order says that "there is a legitimate possibility that particular laws may be imminently violated" and that "ordering compliance with those laws is appropriate."

Even though what most of what Gwin included in his order is covered by certain provisions of Ohio law, the issuance of a restraining order means that a person or group who violates the order could be found in contempt and face sanctions.

The order remains in place until voting for the presidential election is complete. It applies to Trump's campaign, longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone and his groups, "as well as their officers, agents, servants, and employees — and other individuals or groups, including groups associated with the Clinton for Presidency campaign."

(You can read the full order here or at the bottom of this story.)

The order filed four days before Election Day comes after a more than two-hour hearing where the Ohio Democratic Party argued that the judge should enjoin the state Republicans, Trump's campaign and Stone from certain actions they say add up to voter intimidation.

The judge did not include the Ohio Republican Party in the order, saying there was not enough to show that a restraining order against the party was necessary.

Under the order, Democrats and Republicans are prohibited from:

• Hindering or delaying voters from entering or exiting a polling place.

• Conducting any unauthorized "poll watching" inside of polling places and within 100 feet of a polling place, or within 10 feet of a voter in line that extends beyond the boundary. This includes challenging or questioning voters about their eligibility to vote, or training organizing or directing others to do the same.

• "Interrogating, admonishing, interfering with, or verbally harassing voters" at or near polling places, or telling others to do the same.

• Handing out literature at or near polling places that says voter fraud is a crime and describing the penalties.

• Gathering and loitering at and near polling places without the intention to vote.

• Following, taking photos or recording voters at or near polling places, or telling others to do the same.

• Questioning or telling others to question voters at or near polling places "under the guise of the purported "exit polling" or "citizen journalist" operations organized and encouraged by Defendants Stone and Stop the Steal."

Trump's campaign on Friday evening asked the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati to review Gwin's order.
