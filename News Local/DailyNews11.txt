Embattled elex big still on job
CONTROVERSIAL city Board of Elections Commissioner Alan Schulkin, who was caught on tape making wild claims about voter fraud, is still on the job even though his term is up.

Schulkin's term expired Dec. 31, along with those of the other nine board commissioners - but he will keep the post until the City Council confirms a replacement.

The Manhattan Democratic party nominated Jeanine Johnson, a staffer to party chairman Keith Wright, to take Schulkin's spot after the conservative group Project Veritas released video of him railing about widespread voter fraud. There was no evidence to back the allegations, and the mayor called on him to resign.
