President Trump should turn his focus to investigating voter suppression instead of voter fraud, U.S. 
Rep. Terri Sewell, D-Birmingham, said Wednesday. Sewell took to Twitter in response to Trump's assertion that millions of votes were cast illegally --despite no evidence --and his call for an investigation into illegal voting. 
The Alabama congresswoman is among the sponsors of a House bill to restore provisions to the Voting Rights Act that were gutted by the Supreme Court. States including Alabama were previously subject to pre-clearance by the Justice Department before making any changes to its voting laws. The court decision paved the way for Alabama's voter ID laws, which opponents say make it harder for the poor, elderly, minorities and the disabled to cast ballots.
