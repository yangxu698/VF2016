Final tally: Clinton won popular vote by almost 2.9 million
President-elect Donald Trump has spoken of his "massive landslide," but final certified results of the 2016 election show that Hillary Clinton won the nation's popular vote by a margin of almost 2.9 million votes.

The losing candidate took 65,844,954 votes, or 48.2 percent, while the victor had 62,979,879 votes, or 46.1 percent.

Trump is highly sensitive to his popular-vote loss, tweeting that he would have "done even better" and won the popular vote had the election not been a state-by-state struggle for electoral votes.

Of course, the election was decided in three Rust Belt states -- Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania -- which Trump won by a combined total of about 100,000 votes. He won in places, e.g. Erie, Pennsylvania, that voted Democratic in the past.

The Cook Political Report suggested on Wednesday that Trump really won the election in three counties:

York County, Pennsylvania, in the heart of Amish County, is a rural/urban Republican bastion; Waukesha County, Wisconsin, west of Milwaukee, is a white suburban area that has kept GOP Gov. Scott Walker in office; and Macomb County, Michigan, is a swing area that gained fame as home to GOP-voting "Reagan Democrats."

Two past losers of the presidency ran ahead by an even greater margin than Clinton: Andrew Jackson in 1824 and Samuel Tilden in 1896.

Still, the 21st century has seen two elections in which the loser of the popular vote went to the White House. George W. Bush trailed Al Gore by 600,000 votes in 2000 but won the Electoral College with a bare majority of 271 votes -- after the U.S. Supreme Court stopped a recount in Florida.

Gore lost his own home state of Tennessee and Bill Clinton's home state of Arkansas.

Hillary Clinton topped President Obama's 2012 vote total by 389,000 votes.

California was where Hillary Clinton piled up her popular-vote margin. She took 61.3 percent of the Golden State's vote, garnering 8,753,788 votes to 4,483,970 for Trump. The nation's most populous state has now gone for the Democrat in seven straight presidential elections.

(Another center of Clinton strength -- Washington's King County. Clinton received 718,322 votes in the state's most populous county to just 216,339 for Trump. The president-elect received just 21.67 percent of King County's vote.)

Trump made a post-election claim that he would have won the popular vote had it not been for massive voter fraud.

A final study of the returns, released early this week, found almost no evidence of fraud at the polls. The president-elect's claim was blustery nonsense.
