A recount and inspection of ballots cast in Brightons municipal elections is set for Monday after a Jefferson County judge last week ordered the recount amid allegations of voter fraud. 
Arthur Shores Lee, attorney for Brandon Dean, the unofficial winner in the mayoral election last month, said his client denies the allegations. Two candidates  current Mayor Barbara Watkins and ex-Mayor Eddie Cooper  filed a civil suit in the Bessemer Division of Jefferson County Court. 
Lee said a senior citizen had voted twice  once for Dean, once for Watkins  and a clerk brought the incident to the attention of the Alabama Secretary of States office. 
Dean had been accused of requesting dozens of absentee ballots be mailed to his address, but he has denied wrongdoing. His attorney also argued the action wasnt illegal. 
To my knowledge its not inappropriate to apply for an absentee ballot and to turn it into clerk, he said. 
Cooper and Watkins couldnt be reached for comment. Their suit also contends Dean doesnt live in Brighton. Lee said his client has produced ample evidence, including tax and voter registration forms, to support his case. 
The discovery phase in the suit is set for Oct. 10, when the parties are supposed to share evidence.
