As thousands of registered voters are lining up at the polls in Goochland on Nov. 8, readying to help choose the next President of the United States, Judi Reid will not be among them.

That's because both she and her husband have already cast their ballots, joining around 1,300 other Goochland residents who qualified to vote absentee.

While Virginia is not one of the states that allows early voting, registered voters may vote absentee if they meet one of 18 listed criteria, including having a disability or illness; attending a college or university outside of their locality of residence; or serving as a first responder.

Reid, who cited health issues as her reason for voting early, said that her experience working with the registrar's office had been "wonderful," a testament no doubt to the work of Goochland County Registrar Frances Ragland and her staff.

Ragland spent last Friday afternoon as she has spent the last several weeks, patiently answering phone calls, giving out information and encouraging voters to make an effort to know what will be on their ballots before they get to the polls.

The office was a hive of activity, and Ragland confirmed cheerfully that it will only get busier the closer it gets to Election Day.

This year, as the subject of potential voter fraud has been a trending topic, Ragland admits she's gotten more questions than usual about that. But she also insists that her office has taken the proper steps to protect against any kind of unlawful activity.

Perhaps more than anything, Ragland wants to make sure that all of Goochland's nearly 17,000 voters understand that, as long as they are in line by 7 p.m. on Nov. 8, they will be allowed to vote.

"The lines are going to be long," she cautioned, so voters are encouraged to avoid going to the polls during the morning and evening rush hours.
