Saying it wants to counter Donald Trump's warnings of a rigged election, the California Democratic Party is hosting a hotline staffed with attorneys who can address legal questions about voter intimidation.
Voter fraud is rare, though there have been a few irregularities this year.
The party's hotline opened Friday. Volunteers are available to answer non-legal questions about polling hours and locations in English and Spanish.
