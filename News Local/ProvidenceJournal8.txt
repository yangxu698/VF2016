PORTSMOUTH — The Portsmouth Board of Canvassers is asking local police to investigate a suspected case of voter fraud during the November election.

The board emerged from a closed meeting on Friday and issued a statement indicating that it had concluded the case "warranted moving the situation forward to the local law enforcement agency."

"There is no evidence that this is a pattern of voter fraud, but rather a single case," the brief statement read.

No other details were made public, including the names of any suspects or details of the suspected fraud.

The session was attended by members E. Richard Carpender, Glenn Allen and Regina Shers, along with Registrar Jacquie Schulz.

On Thursday, the board confirmed that it was investigating the possible case of fraud, which it said was discovered during an audit.

According to the Newport Daily News, a post-election audit showed "a potential irregularity necessitating the probe." The story said that the person whose ballot is being checked has not been notified. The canvassers meeting will be in executive session because the voter will be identified.
