Rudy joins vote conspiracy talk
FORMER MAYOR Rudy Giuliani, building on Donald Trump's lie that the November election is rigged against him, railed Sunday that he "would have to be a moron to say" that the election in cities like "Philadelphia and Chicago is going to be fair."

Giuliani, who has shamelessly parroted various conspiracy theories touted by Trump over the campaign, added that he thinks it's very likely there will be voter fraud on Nov. 8 that favors Hillary Clinton, especially in urban areas.

"I've found very few situations where Republicans cheat," Giuliani said on CNN's "State of the Union." "They don't control the inner cities the way Democrats do."

"I'm sorry. Dead people generally vote for Democrats rather than Republicans," Giuliani said. "I can't sit here and tell you that they don't cheat, and I know because they control the polling places in these areas."
