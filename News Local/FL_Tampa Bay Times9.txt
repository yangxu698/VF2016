A leading Democratic legislator said Wednesday that Gov. Rick Scott's administration should immediately launch an investigation into President Donald Trump's allegations that widespread voter fraud denied him a popular-vote victory in November. 
Senate Democratic Leader Oscar Braynon, D-Miami Gardens, said in a letter to Secretary of State Ken Detzner: "I believe that charges of election fraud by the President of the United States are far too serious to allow more time to elapse." Citing a state law that gives Detzner authority to act on such allegations, Braynon wrote: "You now have a legal obligation to act." 
Braynon added that "such reviews and purges in the past failed to turn up any evidence of widespread fraud," and said that in some cases, people were falsely accused of fraud, including veterans. But Braynon said Detzner needs to reassure Floridians "that (Trump's) election to the presidency was beyond reproach."
