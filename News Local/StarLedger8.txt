GOVERNOR'S ADMINISTRATION EXPRESSES ‘STRONG CONFIDENCE' IN N.J. BALLOT SECURITY
On the campaign trail, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been sowing doubt in the security of the nation's electoral process.

But the administration of Gov. Chris Christie - a top Trump campaign official and surrogate - says it has "strong confidence" in the system in place here in the Garden State.

In a statement released by Christie's press secretary, Brian Murray, late Friday, state elections officials stressed that New Jersey's statewide voter registration system was not vulnerable to internet hacking in the ways other states like Arizona and Illinois saw their systems compromised this year.

Trump's claims - that the election is "rigged," prone to fraud and that "people that have died 10 years ago are still voting" - don't have much basis in fact. But they nevertheless brought the issue of potential voter fraud and election tampering to the forefront.

This is, after all, the home of former Gov. Brendan Byrne, who famously said: "I want to be buried in Hudson County so that I can remain active in politics."

If anybody wants to tamper with New Jersey's electoral process, officials say, they'll have to do it in person, machine by machine.

"New Jersey law requires voting machines never connect to the internet, making this a discussion of physical security, not cybersecurity," elections officials said in their statement.

Voting machines will use tamper-proof seals, the statement said, and the state's system relies on single-use CDs or flash drives to relay tallies from the machines to a computer to provide unofficial results online.
